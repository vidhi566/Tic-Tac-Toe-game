This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. The game allows two players, 'X' and 'O', to take turns entering their moves until one of them wins or the game ends in a tie.

Features

1. Player input validation to ensure valid moves.
2. Detection of winning conditions for both players.
3. Detection of a tie when the board is full and no player has won.
4. Command-line interface for a straightforward user experience.
5. Clean and modular code structure for easy understanding and maintenance.

How to Play
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java source file TicTacToe.java.
3. Run the compiled program (TicTacToe.class) using java TicTacToe.
4. Follow the prompts to enter your moves (row and column).
